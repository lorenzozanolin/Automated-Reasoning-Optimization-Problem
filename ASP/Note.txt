REQUEST

Write a Minizinc and an ASP program capable of finding a solution to the 
following  problem.
Prepare a battery of 30 benchmark instances.
Generate them randomly but prepare some easy/small instances (a couple 
of running time seconds),
some average instances (a couple of minutes) and some hard instances 
(exceeding timeout).

Run both the Minizinc and the ASP encoding on all the instances,
possibly exploring different search strategies,
with a timeout of 5 minutes for each test
(``configuration'' option in Minizinc, --time-limit option in clingo, in 
both cases you can use linux tricks)

In case of COPs, report the best value for the solution found within the 
timeout.

Write a short report (5-10) pages report containing 1) the problem
as written above 2) your models (and the reasons for some choices),
and 3) a presentation of the execution results.
Prepare the programs and the benchmark instances used in a unique zip file.


==========================================================
Use separate files (instances) and pass them to the general model. 
Instances containes the input, i.e. 
m (rows), n (columns), maxTime (steps upperboud), maxNumber (boxes size upperboud)
k cartons of size s_k and bottom coordinates for each of them.
goals (coordinates) for each box.

Output must contains positions of all cartons within the room.

Each movement is single, i.e. every change of 1 position is a step.
